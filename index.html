'The next morning, I was painting about you,',
'On Wednesday, I started a WhatsApp group for a Shabbat Roller Night Session with you and six other friends.',
'Quietly knowing nobody but us two actually rollerblade',
'Shabbat Roller is the best because not a single car is in the streets of Tel Aviv.',
'You rollerblade on the big avenues with a crazy playlist in your headphones.',
'The city is yours.', 
'On friday, the sun just set, and we met next to Gordon beach.',  
'We stayed rollerblading on this 200 meters square polished concrete for 2 hours.',
'That was not a date.',
'This was a dance.',
'A courtship ritual.',
'Une roulade nuptiale',
'Both of us were turning, dancing, going backwards, chatting, falling, argueing and smiling',
'You showed me a bit of your art, tell me a part of your story', 
'and delicately implied after a little 180 jump on your rollerblades',
'that you were not wearing a bra under your black top.',
'Which I had noticed',
'I was hooked.',
'I wrote this book',
'To come back on our relationship which suddenly stopped after 9 months day to day of deep love.',
'To turn our memories and love into an eternal story.',
'To thank you for showing me your idea of love.',
'For having put all this energy in us',
'To put words on what went wrong.',
'To make wanders between successfull love story and the freedom of rollerblading that got us united.',
'I hope this book will live up to our union.',
